# Lab report template

This report follows [GUL's UC3M LaTeX report template](https://github.com/guluc3m/report-template/). More information and updated versions on the original repository.


## Compilation

First you must install [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

- For Linux, install `texlive-full`.
- For Windows, install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download#win), make sure you add it to your `PATH`, and install [Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). If itâ€™s not installed already, open the MikTeX Package Manager and install the `latexmk` package.
- For MacOS, install [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) and then install `latexmk` with:
    ```
    sudo tlmgr install latexmk
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As we'll use SVG files, you'll need to install [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
> If you're in Windows, make sure to add the executable to your PATH (typically located in `C:\Program Files\Inkscape\bin\`).

To compile the report, use the command:
```
latexmk -cd -shell-escape -pdf report.tex
```
